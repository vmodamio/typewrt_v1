# typewrt_v1
Typewrt is a personal project dedicated to produce the perfect typewriter device. As it is intended to
suit all my needs (and dreams), I did not spare costs. I just wanted a device that did not feel like a 
DIY device to showcase. I wanted an 'instrument' that feels perfect for writing fiction. So this 
project didn't start with a 'distraction free' propaganda in mind, but just simply as a device that 
one truly feel better for the matter of writing and editing fiction.  


A compact device I can write in my desk, solid and heavy. But at the same time something I 
could fit in a small case and take to a coffee shop. First and foremost, something I could take over 
a laptop any time. The criteria? 

The screen, to start with. The LCD displays
